The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format). It consists of movie reviews with relatively longer sentences, allowing for more in-depth sentiment analysis. You can use this dataset into download them in the link or use another dataset (may need to make adjustments to the data preprocessing steps!).
